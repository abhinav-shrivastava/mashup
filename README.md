# mashup

An web application that lets users search for news articles atop a map.

This is a flask based app made utilizing Google Maps API and Google News. Basically you can search for a location (US only) and it'll show you all the recent news of that location. You can also drag and click at a location to see recent news of that place.

Running the application:
- export your Google Maps API-Key using command "export API_KEY = value_of_api_key"
- start Flaskâ€™s built-in web server (within mashup/) by executing the command "flask run"

In case of any difficulty, reach me.
